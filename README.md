# Canary

**Canary** is a privacy-first preparedness app designed to help individuals feel informed, supported, and prepared during immigration enforcement encounters.

Canario is built as a **preparedness and communication tool**, not a resistance platform. Its goal is to reduce confusion, panic, and escalation during high-stress encounters by improving access to timely information and trusted support.

## Project Motivation

As immigration enforcement presence has increased in many U.S. communities, both citizens and non-citizens face gaps in real-time communication, preparedness, and access to clear rights information during enforcement encounters.

Existing awareness efforts primarily rely on general-purpose platforms that are not designed for high-risk or time-sensitive situations. Canario explores how a purpose-built, privacy-conscious system can better support individuals and communities in these moments.
